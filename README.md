# Moodle Plugin Template

Use this template as a starting point for developing Moodle plugins.

**STATUS:** This is a work-in-progress, supporting discussions on best practices.

![File listing](docs/images/file-listing.png)

## Key Features

This template provides a structured, best-practice-compliant foundation for developing Moodle plugins, including:

- üìù Installation instructions for users
- üîß Build system and CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions
- üåç Localization for all strings
- ‚úÖ Automated code style checks
- üöÄ Optional: Unit tests, Behat tests, static analysis, logging, and backup support

This repository offers a functional example of a Moodle plugin, with features like:

- [x] **Database initialization and upgrade** scripts
- [ ] **Dashboard Context block** (`CONTEXT_USER`) to display content on student dashboards ("My home")
- [ ] **Course content block** (`CONTEXT_COURSE`) to display content on course pages
- [ ] **Activity block** (`CONTEXT_MODULE`) to display content on activity pages
- [ ] **Settings page** to configure the plugin using the standard Moodle admin settings interface
- [ ] **Admin page** to access functionality of this plugin that only administrators should see
- [ ] **Scheduled task** to run background processing
- [ ] **Custom JavaScript** for the user interface, which is built using (AMD??)

You can use these features as they are, modify them, or remove what you don‚Äôt need.

## Best Practices and Resources

Follow these best practices to enhance and maintain your plugin:

- **JavaScript Compilation:** [Moodle Node.js Guide](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/nodejs)
- **AMD Compilation:** Examples:
    - [h5p plugin](https://github.com/h5p/moodle-mod_hvp)
    - [attendance plugin](https://github.com/danmarsden/moodle-mod_attendance/tree/MOODLE_404_STABLE/amd)
- **CI Setup:** [Moodle CI Guide](https://moodlehq.github.io/moodle-plugin-ci/)
- **General Examples:** [attendance plugin](https://github.com/danmarsden/moodle-mod_attendance)

## Making Your Own Plugin

1. **Fork this repository** and rename it according to Moodle conventions:
    - Format: `moodle-<type>_<pluginname>` (e.g., `moodle-local_example`)
    - `<type>` should match Moodle‚Äôs [plugin types](https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/plugintypes).

2. **Customize the README**: Replace content below this line to describe your plugin.

3. **Publish and Release**: Remove this line and above, then publish your repository as version 1.0.0!

# High Five Plugin

Enable students to "high five" each other! Enhance engagement and community.

Supported Moodle versions: ![CI status](https://github.com/fulldecent/moodle-local_plugin_template/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Features

- üéâ High Five page at `/local/high_five/`
  <img src="docs/images/greeting.png" width=400>

## Quick Start with Playground

Set up a Moodle environment in minutes for testing your plugin locally:

### Steps:

1. **Install Docker**:
    - Recommended for Mac: [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/)
    - Windows/Linux: (add recommended option)

2. **Prepare Moodle Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd ~/Developer
   mkdir moodle-playground && cd moodle-playground


## Quick start playground

:runner: Run a Moodle playground site with *High Five* on your own computer in under 5 minutes! Zero programming or Moodle experience required.

1. Install a Docker system:

   1. On macOS we currently recommend [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/). This is the only software which can install Moodle in under 5 minutes. We would prefer if an open source product can provide this experince, but none such exists. See [references](#references) below if you may prefer another option.
   2. On Windows (TODO: add open source recommendation)
   3. On Linux (TODO: add open source recommendation)

2. Create a Moodle testing folder. You will use this to test this plugin, but you could also mix in other plugins onto the same system if you like.

   ```sh
   cd ~/Developer
   mkdir moodle-playground && cd moodle-playground
   ```

3. Install the latest version of Moodle:

   ```sh
   # Visit https://moodledev.io/general/releases to find the latest release, like X.Y.
   
   export BRANCH=MOODLE_X0Y_STABLE # update X and Y here to match the latest release version
   git clone --depth=1 --branch $BRANCH git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git
   ```

   *:information_source: If you see the error "fatal: Remote branch MOODLE_X0Y_STABLE not found in upstream origin", please reread instruction in the code comment and try again.*

4. Install this plugin into your Moodle playground:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fulldecent/moodle-local_plugin_template.git moodle/local/high_five
   ```

5. Get and run Moodle Docker container (instructions adapted from [moodle-docker instructions](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker)):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker.git
   cd moodle-docker # You are now at ~/Developer/moodle-playground/moodle-docker
   
   export MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT=../moodle
   export MOODLE_DOCKER_DB=pgsql
   bin/moodle-docker-compose up -d
   bin/moodle-docker-wait-for-db
   
   cp config.docker-template.php $MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT/config.php
   bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/cli/install_database.php --agree-license --fullname="Docker moodle" --shortname="docker_moodle" --summary="Docker moodle site" --adminpass="test" --adminemail="admin@example.com" --adminuser='admin'
   ```

   *:information_source: If you see the error "Database tables already present; CLI installation cannot continue", please follow the "teardown" instructions below and then try again.*

   *:information_source: If you see the error "!!! Site is being upgraded, please retry later. !!!", and "Error code: upgraderunning‚Ä¶", please ignore the error and proceed.*

6. :sun_with_face: Now play with your server at https://localhost:8000

   1. Click the top-right to login.
   2. Your username is `admin` and your password is `test`.

   *:information_source: If you see a bunch of stuff and "Update Moodle database now", then click that button and wait. On a M1 Mac with 8GB ram, we saw this take 5 minutes for the page to finish loading.*

7. To completely kill your playground so that next time you will start with a blank slate:

   ```sh
   bin/moodle-docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
   colima stop
   ```

If you have any further questions about the playground setup, customizing it or other error messages, please documentation at https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker and contact that team.

## Install

To install High Five on your quality assurance server or your production server, do the same thing as the plaground example above:

1. ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fulldecent/moodle-local_plugin_template.git local/high_five
   ```

2. Load your website in the browser to set up plugins.

## References

1. This module is built based on [best practices documented in moodle-local_plugin_template](https://github.com/fulldecent/moodle-local_plugin_template).
2. Setting up Docker
   1. We would prefer an open-source-licensed Docker implementation that runs at native speed on Mac, Linux and Windows. For Mac, you may prefer to [install Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) which is open source but about 5x slower than the OrbStack recommended above.
3. Setting up playground
   1. If you require a few courses and users to test your plugin, you may want to look at the [generator tool](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/generator).
4. Continuous integration
   1. This plugin uses [the Moodle CI suite recommended by Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst/catalyst-moodle-workflows)
   2. Perhaps we would prefer the CI suite provided by Moodle, but their approach [does not allow you to set it once and forget it](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/323)
